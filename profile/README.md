# OpenHumidistat

Here you can find the sources for the firmware, software utilities, and hardware of OpenHumidistat, a free and open-source humidistat for laboratory-scale humidity control that is affordable and easy to build.

Using OpenHumidistat, you can realise humidity control for your experimental setups for about â‚¬500 (and some of your time to build it). OpenHumidistat is designed to provide standalone control of the humidity in a small measurement chamber (~ 10 - 100 mL). It features:

- Fast and precise dynamic response
  - Settling time of ~ 10 s
- Broad attainable humidity range of approximately 10-90% (depending on humidifier efficacy and feed gas conditions)
- Flowrate up to 2 L/min
- High accuracy and good disturbance rejection through closed-loop control
- Easy and intuitive operation
- Excellent versatility and portability: can be applied to a wide range of experimental setups
- Optional monitoring/logging of controller state using Python utility on a PC connected over USB

The design is based around mixing a humid and dry air flow in varying proportions, using proportional solenoid valves and flow sensors to control flow rates. The mixed flow is led into a measurement chamber, which contains a humidity sensor to provide feedback to the controller, to achieve closed-loop humidity control.

There are two versions of the humidistat, the development of which are described in the two papers listed below.

v1             |  v2 (OpenHumidistat)

The second version features upgraded components including a much more powerful microcontroller and better humidity sensor, performance and stability improvements to the controller itself (cascade PID control using flow sensors), a much fancier interface, and on-the-fly configurability.

## Getting started

If you are interested in building OpenHumidistat, it is strongly recommended to consider the second version. Besides upgrades to the hardware, [the article describing it](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08500) includes comprehensive step-by-step build instructions. PCB designs for the custom circuits and 3D models for the enclosure are also provided for your convenience.
